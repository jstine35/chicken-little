Chicken Little Coder Todo List

News 10-12-2000:

 I decided to start fresh since most or all of the things listed in the old TODO
 had actually been completed, or very nearly so.  Now we get to list things in
 the order we want to do them, and not the order they have to be done in (for
 competition, etc).

 I'm actually going to try to keep this file open as I work and list changes as
 I make them.  I have no idea how successful this idea will be, but alas I shall
 give it a try... :)
